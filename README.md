# Landing Page Project

## Description

Project taken from Udacity **Java Script and the DOM** course for learning how to manipulate html document using DOM apis.

It consists of a multi-section landing page that dynamically add a navigation menu to the page header. 

The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. 

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. 


## Usage

The sections are illustrated with deafult `lorem ipsum` text as placeholders. 

Whenever each section is being viewed it is distinguished from the others with a background color change and animated circles at its top and bottom.

When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the page smoothly scrolls to the appropriate section.
